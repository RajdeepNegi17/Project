1.	Recommender System 


Introduction: 
E-commerce companies like Amazon, flipkart, etc. now a days use different recommendation systems to provide their
customer suggestions for the products of their interest. Recommender system creates a similarity between the user and items 
and exploits the similarity between user/item to make recommendations.


Problem Statement: 
Design a recommender system using product reviews that provide the product recommendation to the user,
of their interest or the popular products currently in the trend.


Procedure:  
First we will download the dataset. Our dataset contain User Id, Product Id, Rating and Time stamp.
Then we will import some necessary libraries. Then afterwards we will be analyzing the rating of different products we have, no. of unique users and products, etc.
We have dropped the Time Stamp column as it was not useful to us.

Then we have created 3 types of recommender system-
1. Popularity Based (recommends the items in trend now)
2.  Collaborative Filtering (recommendation of products for people having similar tastes)
3. Model based (training model to make them able to predict products of interest) 

More Detailed information regarding the project code is mentioned in the comments alongside the code describing what a particular piece of code does and why we are doing it.


Conclusion:
We have created a recommender system that provides the recommendation of top products based on the userâ€™s interest.Thus helping each specific user to find the right product of their need and interest.
